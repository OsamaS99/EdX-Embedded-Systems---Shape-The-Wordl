# Lab6_BranchingFunctionsDelays subject

Lab achieved with a score of 100% in simulation and real board tests.

## Purpose

The purpose of this lab is to implement programming structures in C. \
You will also learn how to estimate how long it takes to run software, and use this estimation to create a time delay function. \
You learn how to use the oscilloscope to measure time delay. 

## System Requirements

The system has one input switch and one output LED.

1. Make PF2 an output and make PF4 an input (enable PUR for PF4). 
2. The system starts with the LED ON (make PF2 =1). 
3. Delay for about 100 ms
4. If the switch is pressed (PF4 is 0), then toggle the LED once, else turn the LED ON. 
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 over and over.
